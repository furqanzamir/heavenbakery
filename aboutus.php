            <h4>FOR OTHERS, BAKING IS CRAFTSMANSHIP. <br/>FOR US A JOYFUL PLEASURE.</h4>
            <p>We admit that we stand by traditions. And the quality of homemade pastries and pies love. </p>

            <p>We also have a big weakness for people who value delicious soul food. And want to share pleasurable moments with others. That's why we put great emphasis on real craftsmanship, special creativity and natural, high-quality ingredients in the production of our cakes. Of course, from local cultivation and wherever possible without the addition of preservatives.</p>

            <p>Oh yes - you will not find industrial mass production here. There are plenty of products that we produce daily fresh and handmade for you with own recipes and special taste.</p>

            <p>But actually we should not talk so much about our products. Better, you make your own picture and create your own cake. For you alone, your friends and colleagues or you all together. Because we think: life can not be sweet enough.</p>

          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p>Serving or giving away a cake is a wonderful, old tradition - which, in my opinion, is far too short in our fast-paced everyday life, explains Flavio Cuoni, founder of Biskitty. This is partly because today hardly anyone learns to properly bake. But even if someone can bake, the time is often simply not there. Using the technical power of the internet, my team and I want to make the pie what it once was: the colorful eye-catcher on the birthday party, a personal, stylish gift for people you like or just a little one Luxury for yourself. </p>
